## Goals Achieved

### 1. Prediction Logic
We successfully developed a robust logic capable of predicting Bundesliga outcomes and the expected number of goals. This logic integrates statistical models and historical data analysis to deliver reliable match forecasts.

### 2. Overview of Past Games and Bundesliga Table
Our app provides a comprehensive overview of past games, including:
- Match results.
- Goal details.
- An updated Bundesliga table reflecting the latest standings after each game.

This feature ensures users can track performance trends and contextualize predictions.

### 3. Detailed Team Performance Statistics
We implemented detailed performance metrics for each team, including:
- Goals scored and conceded.
- Win, loss, and draw records.
- Home and away performance.
- Player contributions and key match events.

These statistics enhance the depth of analysis and provide users with actionable insights into team dynamics.

## Goals Missed

### 1. Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
We aimed to build and integrate an RNN model that would:
- Continuously learn from weekly game data.
- Adapt to evolving team and player dynamics.
- Improve prediction accuracy over time.

While this goal remains unachieved, it is a high-priority item for future development. Implementing the RNN will require additional data preprocessing pipelines, computational resources, and iterative training strategies to optimize performance.
