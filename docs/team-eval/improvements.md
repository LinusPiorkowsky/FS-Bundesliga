## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Enhancing Prediction Models
One of the key areas for improvement is the development of a recurrent neural network (RNN). This would allow our system to:
- Continuously adapt and learn from new data.
- Provide more accurate and dynamic predictions.
- Incorporate evolving trends in team and player performance.

### 2. Community Feedback Integration
Leveraging user feedback to refine the app is crucial:
- Implement feedback mechanisms to gather insights from users.
- Prioritize features that align with user needs and preferences.
- Establish a beta testing group to trial new features and receive iterative input.

### 3. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Ensuring the app can handle increased user demand and data volume:
- Optimize backend systems for scalability.
- Improve response times and reduce latency.
- Plan infrastructure upgrades as the user base grows.
