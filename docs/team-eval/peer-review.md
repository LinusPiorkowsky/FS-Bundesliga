### **Henry Lükewille - Review 1**

#### **My observation**

Henry has demonstrated technical expertise in managing the back-end functionality and predictive modeling aspects of the project. Specifically, he has shown remarkable attention to detail when working with the dataset for the Bundesliga predictions. His approach to integrating the new season data into the existing structure, merging datasets, and ensuring the data is up-to-date has been critical for the success of the prediction model. Additionally, his problem-solving skills have been a major asset in tackling unexpected issues that arise in the project, particularly when adjusting the model to account for various football match variables.

He has also actively contributed to the refinement of the app's back-end code by ensuring scalability and optimizing the codebase to handle larger datasets efficiently. His leadership in this area has ensured that the technical side of the project is stable and capable of handling future updates and enhancements.

#### **Effect on me**

Henry's commitment to ensuring the dataset is continuously updated with the latest football season data has had a positive impact on my work. His precision and thoroughness in data handling gave me confidence in the accuracy of the prediction model, which in turn allowed me to focus more on my tasks, knowing that the data being used is reliable. Moreover, his proactive communication about technical issues and progress updates helped maintain transparency within the team and kept me well-informed. This made it easier for me to adjust my workflow when necessary and contribute effectively to the development process.

The collaborative approach Henry brought to the project also made the process enjoyable, as he consistently offered assistance when my tasks intersected with his area of work, fostering a sense of teamwork and mutual respect.

#### **Tip for the future**

While Henry's technical skills are strong, I suggest further strengthening the documentation for the back-end processes. While the code is well-organized, having more in-depth documentation for specific functions and processes, particularly regarding how datasets are merged and processed, would be immensely beneficial for onboarding new team members or ensuring continuity if the project is handed over in the future. I also believe it would be helpful to hold occasional discussions or brainstorming sessions with me about the expected outcomes of the model to ensure alignment with the overall goals of the app, ensuring that the project vision is shared and clarified early on.

### **Linus Piorkowsky - Review 2**

#### **My observation**

Linus has consistently shown an outstanding ability to balance both technical and creative aspects of app development, particularly in the UI/UX design of the application. His work on the user interface has transformed the application into an intuitive, engaging experience for users. The CSS updates he made to the prediction page have not only made it visually appealing but also contributed to making the layout more user-friendly and accessible. His attention to detail when aligning the design elements with the functionality of the app has created a seamless user experience.

Linus has also shown great adaptability in integrating the front-end design with the back-end systems, ensuring smooth transitions between pages and improving the app's overall performance. He has been proactive in troubleshooting UI bugs and ensuring that the app maintains its responsiveness across various devices, enhancing the accessibility of the platform.

#### **Effect on me**

Linus' work on the UI has greatly affected my own workflow by allowing me to focus on the predictive modeling aspects without having to worry about how the final output would be presented. His ability to make the app’s interface intuitive has made testing and evaluating the prediction outputs much easier and more efficient. The improved design has made interactions with the app smoother, resulting in less friction between users and the system, which in turn encourages deeper engagement with the app.

Moreover, Linus’ attention to detail has set a high standard for the visual aspects of the project, making me feel more motivated to ensure my own contributions, particularly regarding data accuracy and presentation, align with the overall user experience goals. His professionalism and excellent communication skills during collaboration also made it a pleasure to work together.

#### **Tip for the future**

While Linus' work on the UI has been exceptional, I encourage him to focus even more on accessibility features for a more inclusive user experience. Furthermore, as the app is likely to grow with more features and complexity, it would be beneficial for Linus to consider scalability from a design perspective, ensuring that the UI can accommodate future updates and additional features without sacrificing the clean, user-friendly design.

Additionally, I think it would be valuable for Linus to work more closely with me on defining the exact requirements for user-facing features, ensuring that the design can best support the technical functionalities Henry is developing. Having both technical and creative perspectives aligned from the outset can prevent potential mismatches in expectations.
