## 01: Prediction Flow

### Meta

Status
: **Completed**

Updated
: 30-Jan-2025

### Purpose

Assess how users interact with the **Bundesliga Predictor** when generating and interpreting match predictions. Primary considerations:
- Is the process of predicting a match outcome clear and straightforward?
- Can users easily compare predicted results to actual match outcomes?
- Do participants find the performance metrics (goals for, recent form, etc.) informative?

### Procedure

1. Selected 5 football enthusiasts with varying degrees of technology fluency.  
2. Instructed them to:
   - Create an account.
   - Generate predictions for upcoming Bundesliga fixtures.
   - Examine past predictions and compare them to real scores.
   - Explore the “Teams” section to analyze form and stats.
3. Observed participants using a screen share and asked clarifying questions during their process.
4. Measured time taken to complete each step and noted any difficulties encountered.
5. Conducted brief follow-up interviews to gather detailed feedback and suggestions.

### Observations

1. **Completion Rates**
   - Creating a prediction for a single fixture: 100% (average time: 1 minute)
   - Viewing previous results: 100% (average time: 1 minute)
   - Navigating team stats pages: 60% (two participants had trouble understanding advanced metrics)

2. **Key Insights**
   - Users appreciated the quick overview of match histories, which made it easier to guess outcomes.
   - The clean layout and color-coded probabilities helped users instantly see which team was favored.
   - Some participants were unclear on how the Predictor calculates its win/draw/loss percentages.
   - Most testers found the process of comparing past predictions with actual outcomes engaging.

3. **Common Issues**
   - Lack of a simple guide or tooltip explaining the logic behind the predictions.
   - Advanced stats (e.g., expected goals) were hidden too deep in the interface, causing confusion.
   - Participants wanted more real-time data, such as injury updates or team sheets.

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Adjustments**
   - Improve navigation labels so users can more easily find injury and squad status.

2. **Long-Term Enhancements**
   - Consider implementing a tutorial or interactive walkthrough for first-time users.
   - Allow users to compare multiple fixtures side-by-side for a better overview of each matchday.

3. **Future Testing**
   - Plan another evaluation session once the tutorial and advanced stats features are live.
   - Gather feedback about how well the real-time data influences prediction accuracy.
