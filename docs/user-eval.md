## 01: Prediction Flow

### Meta

**Status:** Completed  
**Updated:** 08-Feb-2025  

### Purpose

Assess how users interact with the **Bundesliga Predictor** when generating and interpreting match predictions. Key questions:
- Is the prediction process clear and intuitive?
- Can users easily compare predictions with actual match results?
- Are the provided performance metrics (goals for, recent form, etc.) informative?

### Procedure

1. Selected five football enthusiasts with varying levels of tech fluency.  
2. Instructed them to:
   - Create an account.
   - Generate predictions for upcoming Bundesliga fixtures.
   - Compare past predictions to real match outcomes.
   - Explore the “Teams” section to analyze form and stats.
3. Observed users via screen share and asked clarifying questions.
4. Measured time taken for each step and noted challenges.
5. Conducted brief interviews to gather feedback and suggestions.

### Observations

#### Completion Rates
- Creating a prediction: **100%** (Avg. time: 1 min)
- Viewing previous results: **100%** (Avg. time: 1 min)
- Navigating team stats: **60%** (Two users struggled with advanced metrics)

#### Key Insights
- Users liked the quick match history overview, which made predictions easier.
- The clean layout and color-coded probabilities enhanced usability.
- Some were unsure how the Predictor calculates win/draw/loss probabilities.
- Most users found comparing past predictions with actual results engaging.

#### Common Issues
- No simple guide or tooltip explaining prediction logic.
- Advanced stats (e.g., expected goals) were difficult to find.
- Users wanted real-time data, such as injury updates or team sheets.
